## Description

The Schedule Plus is a desktop application designed to streamline client, project, time log, employee, and subconsultant management. Built using Python and the Tkinter GUI library, it provides a tabbed interface for managing different aspects of project workflows. This application aims to centralize key operational tasks, making it easier to track project progress, manage time logs, and handle employee/subconsultant information. It leverages lazy loading to optimize performance, instantiating manager classes only when their corresponding tabs are accessed. The application also features a custom style configuration for a consistent and modern user experience. Data storage is handled through `mysql.connector`, implying a MySQL database backend.

- **Time Log Management:** Provides functionality for tracking and managing time logs associated with projects and employees.
